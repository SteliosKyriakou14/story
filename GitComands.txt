Version Control

git init (initialize to git to a directory and that directory becomes our working directory)

git status (shows us which files are in the staging area and which are not)
(also can track the changes if file is red means file has been modified)

git add filename.filetype (adds a file to the staging area in order to choose which files you would like to commit)
commit: truck the changes of those files 

git add . (adds all files to staging are and are ready to commit) 

git commit -m "commit message" (this adds all files to our local repository)

git log (to see commits)

git diff filename.filetype (see the differences between current file and the one previously commited)

git checkout filename.filetype (go back to the previous (commited) version of the edited file)
